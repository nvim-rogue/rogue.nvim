## Description

This Vim plugin is a game that is porting of Rogue-clone II. You can enjoy the
game on your Vim. This rogue-clone is message-separated, and so you can make
your original message file.

By the way, you can get the original of this game from FreeBSD ports
`japanese/rogue_s`.

Please read [help](doc/rogue.txt) for details.
